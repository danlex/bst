Binary Search Tree library
===
Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:[1]

* The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
* The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
* Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
* There must be no duplicate nodes.
